Just saw The Wedding Banquet and, man, I'm kinda wrecked but also buzzing with energy that I didn't ask for. Strange, you know, going in thinking it's just about a wedding—surprise, surprise, it’s as much about identity, family, and pretending like half your life isn't staged for people who’d rather not know the truth. And trust me, as a bus driver, I've seen my share of facades and forced smiles, folks crafting little sagas of happiness on my bus seats.

I mean, we've got Wei-Tung, who's gay but playing it straight with this whole ridiculous wedding setup. I can't help but feel a weird mix of sympathy and “dude, what the heck?” because I just can’t wrap my brain around living like that daily. Dude’s solving a Rubik's cube but with his life choices—like, can you even?

>Then there are the parents. They fly in from Taiwan with this blissful ignorance only parents can muster. You’ve gotta admire it and fear it at the same time. I kept thinking about the lady who gave me an earful this morning for missing her stop—bet she's got a story like this buried under her complaints about delayed buses. Seriously though, the acting felt so raw at times. It’s like watching people peel potatoes but with their emotions. Don’t ask, just go with it.

At one point, I swear the film almost made my heart do that awkward samba when Wei-Tung’s father had that heart-to-heart moment. Seeing real acceptance unfold is like finding a mint-condition comic in a bargain bin—unexpectedly brilliant yet slightly absurd. But, boy, they sure know how to thaw that ice-cold grip of fear, don’t they? It just melted away at the end.

function weddingBanquet() {
    var loveConfusion = true;
    while (loveConfusion) {
        console.log(Pretend till you don't.);
        break;
    }
}

And Gina—the unintentionally hilarious, slightly sarcastic friend—kind of like that stray cat that keeps showing up uninvited but somehow makes the day better. At some point, I actually thought all this pretending is like trying real hard not to sneeze—totally unnatural but sometimes necessary. Maybe I should just download the movie, watch the movie, and see if my mind won't stop jumping hoops with this like it's in a circus ring.

Anyways, absolutely shattered yet utterly invigorated by it. I came out of that theater like, “Damn, people live with some serious tangled-up heartstrings, don’t they?” Makes my bus route drama seems like a leisurely stroll through the park, with maybe a particularly persistent squirrel.
